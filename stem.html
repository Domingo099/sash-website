With the STEM strand, graduates will: Have developed a keener sense of creativity and ingenuity which is essential in coming up with new ideas and innovations. Be more inclined to experiment and be more open to risks. Be able to apply the knowledge they’ve learned in class in everyday scenarios, most especially in their future courses. Have the foundational competencies that will allow them to excel in their chosen courses and, eventually, help them qualify for jobs in the STEM strand.</h2></td>
            <td><h2>The STEM strand gives senior high school students exposure to the intertwining disciplines (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) to see how they work in real life. The STEM strand: Builds resilience in a safe environment by allowing students to experiment and to naturally experience failures as part of the learning process. Encourages teamwork so students can find solutions to problems, record data, write reports, give presentations, and prepare them for STEM strand jobs. Teaches kids about the power and importance of technology, especially in today’s digital age. Fosters a habit of adaption when things don’t go as planned.</h2></td>
